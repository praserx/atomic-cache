# Copilot Instructions

This project implements a high-performance in-memory cache in Go, optimized for low-latency data retrieval in performance-critical systems. The codebase primarily leverages the Go standard library and select well-maintained packages to ensure operational stability, maintainability, and ease of integration into production environments.

## Coding Standards

- This is a Go (Golang) project.
- Write idiomatic, clean, and readable Go with clear inline comments where necessary.
- Prioritize performance and simplicity, with a primary focus on efficient caching mechanisms.
- Develop composable, testable functions to facilitate maintainability and reuse.
- Write unit tests using the testing package for all handlers and core logic.
- Use the Go standard library and select well-maintained packages to ensure stability and reduce dependency surface area.
- Ensure the codebase is clear, consistent, and approachable for contributors.
- Ensure go build ./... and go test ./... pass without errors before submitting changes.
- Include structured log output with contextual information to support debugging and observability.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages outlining the purpose and scope of changes.
- If implementation guidance is needed, seek clarification promptly. Do not fabricate or assume correctness without validation.
